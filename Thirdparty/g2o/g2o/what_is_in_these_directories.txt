stuff:		is a general library containing utilities to manipulate
       		strings, to open files and other unsorted components.  

core:  		this is the base library of g2o

types: 		Here are some types plugins for g2o, organized as
		application domain.  This is the list:
			
		slam3d: types for 3D slam. The vertices can represent
		robot poses with 6dof and the constraints can
		represent pose-pose constraint.
		
		sim3: types for representing an unknown-scale SLAM
		problem.  the vertices represent elements of sim3 (3d
		pose + scale), and the edges represent constraints
		spatial constraints between these sim3 vertices.

		sba: types for bundle adjustment. The vertices include
		intrinsic camera parameters, 3D points, extrinsic
		parameters.  The edges include: monocular projection,
		monocular projection with parameters (3-edge), stereo
		projection and scale constraint between extrinsic
		nodes.  There are also types for BA that are based on
		the exponential map parameterization.

solvers:	Here are the linear solver plugins: dense, Eigen.
